	abstract = {A key prerequisite for residential energy conservation is knowing when and where energy is being spent. Unfortunately, the current generation of energy reporting devices only provide partial and coarse grained information or require expensive professional installation. This limitation stems from the presumption that calculating per-appliance consumption requires per-appliance current measurements. However, since appliances typically emit measurable signals when they are consuming energy, we can estimate their consumption using indirect sensing. This paper presents ViridiScope, a fine-grained power monitoring system that furnishes users with an economical, self-calibrating tool that provides power consumption of virtually every appliance in the home. ViridiScope uses ambient signals from inexpensive sensors placed near appliances to estimate power consumption, thus no in-line sensor is necessary. We use a model-based machine learning algorithm that automates the sensor calibration process. Through experiments in a real house, we show that ViridiScope can estimate the end-point power consumption within 10\% error.},

This paper presents the performances of a small household scale battery energy storage system with a lithium-ion battery pack and a single-phase ac-dc inverter. Results of a list of tests conducted in a lab environment are presented explaining the test procedures and results.
Test results show that the considered BESS is suitable for daily cycling applications but has low efficiencies at the rated power operations. Converter losses contribute to the low efficiency of the considered BESS. The BESS is more efficient in lower power (lower than rated) operations. However, the effects of the current harmonics need to be considered when it is operated with other appliances.},

	abstract = {Peak demand for electricity in North America is expected to grow, challenging electrical utilities to supply this demand in a cost-effective, reliable manner. Therefore, there is growing interest in strategies to reduce peak demand by eliminating electricity use, or shifting it to non-peak times. This strategy is commonly called “demand response”. In households, common strategies are time-varying pricing, which charge more for energy use on peak, or direct load control, which allows utilities to curtail certain loads during high demand periods. We reviewed recent North American studies of these strategies. The data suggest that the most effective strategy is a critical peak price (CPP) program with enabling technology to automatically curtail loads on event days. There is little evidence that this causes substantial hardship for occupants, particularly if they have input into which loads are controlled and how, and have an override option. In such cases, a peak load reduction of at least 30\% is a reasonable expectation. It might be possible to attain such load reductions without enabling technology by focusing on household types more likely to respond, and providing them with excellent support. A simple time-of-use (TOU) program can only expect to realise on-peak reductions of 5\%.},

	doi = {10.1109/PerCom.2012.6199851},
	abstract = {Flattening household electricity demand reduces generation costs, since costs are disproportionately affected by peak demands. While the vast majority of household electrical loads are interactive and have little scheduling flexibility (TVs, microwaves, etc.), a substantial fraction of home energy use derives from background loads with some, albeit limited, flexibility. Examples of such devices include A/Cs, refrigerators, and dehumidifiers. In this paper, we study the extent to which a home is able to transparently flatten its electricity demand by scheduling only background loads with such flexibility. We propose a Least Slack First (LSF) scheduling algorithm for household loads, inspired by the well-known Earliest Deadline First algorithm. We then integrate the algorithm into Smart-Cap, a system we have built for monitoring and controlling electric loads in homes. To evaluate LSF, we collected power data at outlets, panels, and switches from a real home for 82 days. We use this data to drive simulations, as well as experiment with a real testbed implementation that uses similar background loads as our home. Our results indicate that LSF is most useful during peak usage periods that exhibit “peaky” behavior, where power deviates frequently and significantly from the average. For example, LSF decreases the average deviation from the mean power by over 20\% across all 4-hour periods where the deviation is at least 400 watts.},

The key technological driver for these gains are the novel sensor network deployments and the large amounts of data that they generate. The challenge however is making sense of this data, and using it effectively to design smarter building control schemes. Several recent research efforts have sought to address the challenge of data access and building control. However, while these systems have made progress in specific areas, many unanswered questions still revolve around data management and what exactly it means to develop building applications. Critically, how would such a solution work in a real building setting and how can applications be written such that they can be re-used in other settings? To resolve these issues we have developed BuildingDepot 2.0, a building management control platform that significantly updates on our first iteration of the system for data analysis and high level supervisory control.},

High investment costs of battery systems, however, prevent positive financial returns for most present residential battery installations in Germany. Tesla Motors, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA, USA) announced a novel battery system—the Powerwall—for only about 25\% of the current German average market price. According to Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk, Germany is one of the key markets for their product. He has, however, not given numbers to support his statement. In this paper, we analyze the economic benefit of the Powerwall for end-users with respect to various influencing parameters: electricity price, aging characteristics of the batteries, topology of battery system coupling, subsidy schemes, and retrofitting of existing PV systems. Simulations show that three key-factors strongly influence economics: the price gap between electricity price and remuneration rate, the battery system’s investment cost, and the usable battery capacity. We reveal under which conditions a positive return on invest can be achieved and outline that the Powerwall could be a worthwhile investment in multiple, but not all, scenarios investigated. Resulting trends are generally transferrable to other home storage products.},

	doi = {10.1109/SustainIT.2015.7101360},
	abstract = {Balancing electricity supply and consumption is critical for the stable performance of an electricity Grid. Demand Side Management (DSM) refers to shifting consumers' energy usage to off-peaks as much as possible to avoid more electricity demand than available supply during peak times. Artificial intelligent planning algorithms have been applied to enabling electric devices to reschedule their operation to off-peak. One such algorithm is Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which takes advantage of tree search and random sampling on decision space in order to fine an optimal domain decision. In particular for DSM, MCTS has been used to control both smart meters and also electrical devices, In both applications, MCTS acts as a centralized consumption planner choosing the optimum approach for all devices in the space. Centralized computation thread limits these approaches in terms of flexibility and scalability. as applied in domains outside DSM, an alternative, decentralized MCTS algorithm, called Parallel MCTS (P-MCTS), allows every agent to run its independent MCTS thread to have its own solution. In thios paper, frist we studied the feasibility of applying P-MCTS in DSM to make demand planning more flexible and scalable. P-MCTS has been evaluated by running two different scenarios one with 6 electrical vehicles (EVs) and the other with 90 EVs which roughly results in 30\% peak load shifting for P-MCTS. To improve the results of P-MCTS, we propose a new decentralized collaborative approach, called Collaborative P-MCTS (CP-MCTS), which exploits and extends P-MCTS to enable each electrical device to actively affect the planning process but also to improve the final decision using collective knowledge obtained during the collaboration. Additionally, in comparison with P-MCTS, CP-MCTS obtained better results, including more peak load shufting and smoother load curve due to 30\% lower Peak to Average Ratio (PAR).},

	abstract = {Power forecasting is an important factor for planning the operations of photovoltaic (PV) system. This paper presents an advanced statistical method for solar power forecasting based on artificial intelligence techniques. The method requires as input past power measurements and meteorological forecasts of solar irradiance, relative humidity and temperature at the site of the photovoltaic power system. A self-organized map (SOM) is trained to classify the local weather type of 24 h ahead provided by the online meteorological services. A unique feature of the method is that following a preliminary weather type classification, the neural networks can be well trained to improve the forecast accuracy. The proposed method is suitable for operational planning of transmission system operator, i.e. forecasting horizon of 24 h ahead and for PV power system operators trading in electricity markets. Application of the forecasting method on the power production of an actual PV power system shows the validity of the method.},

In this article we investigate whether Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) is an interesting alternative for one-player games where A∗ and IDA∗ methods do not perform well. Therefore, we propose a new MCTS variant, called single-player Monte-Carlo tree search (SP-MCTS). The selection and backpropagation strategy in SP-MCTS are different from standard MCTS. Moreover, SP-MCTS makes use of randomized restarts. We tested IDA∗ and SP-MCTS on the puzzle SameGame and used the cross-entropy method to tune the SP-MCTS parameters. It turned out that our SP-MCTS program is able to score a substantial number of points on the standardized test set.},

	abstract = {Real-time electricity pricing models can potentially lead to economic and environmental advantages compared to the current common flat rates. In particular, they can provide end users with the opportunity to reduce their electricity expenditures by responding to pricing that varies with different times of the day. However, recent studies have revealed that the lack of knowledge among users about how to respond to time-varying prices as well as the lack of effective building automation systems are two major barriers for fully utilizing the potential benefits of real-time pricing tariffs. We tackle these problems by proposing an optimal and automatic residential energy consumption scheduling framework which attempts to achieve a desired trade-off between minimizing the electricity payment and minimizing the waiting time for the operation of each appliance in household in presence of a real-time pricing tariff combined with inclining block rates. Our design requires minimum effort from the users and is based on simple linear programming computations. Moreover, we argue that any residential load control strategy in real-time electricity pricing environments requires price prediction capabilities. This is particularly true if the utility companies provide price information only one or two hours ahead of time. By applying a simple and efficient weighted average price prediction filter to the actual hourly-based price values used by the Illinois Power Company from January 2007 to December 2009, we obtain the optimal choices of the coefficients for each day of the week to be used by the price predictor filter. Simulation results show that the combination of the proposed energy consumption scheduling design and the price predictor filter leads to significant reduction not only in users' payments but also in the resulting peak-to-average ratio in load demand for various load scenarios. Therefore, th- - e deployment of the proposed optimal energy consumption scheduling schemes is beneficial for both end users and utility companies.},

	abstract = {Temperature warnings are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property. Temperature forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the temperature for a future time and a given location. Temperature forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere. In this paper, a neural network-based algorithm for predicting the temperature is presented. The Neural Networks package supports different types of training or learning algorithms. One such algorithm is Back Propagation Neural Network (BPN) technique. The main advantage of the BPN neural network method is that it can fairly approximate a large class of functions. This method is more efficient than numerical differentiation. The simple meaning of this term is that our model has potential to capture the complex relationships between many factors that contribute to certain temperature. The proposed idea is tested using the real time dataset. The results are compared with practical working of meteorological department and these results confirm that our model have the potential for successful application to temperature forecasting. Real time processing of weather data indicate that the BPN based weather forecast have shown improvement not only over guidance forecasts from numerical models, but over official local weather service forecasts as well.},

	abstract = {We describe an approach for how to design an essentially more scalable, flexible and resilient electric power infrastructure – one that encourages efficient use, integrates local generation, and manages demand through omnipresent awareness of energy availability and use over time. We are inspired by how the Internet has revolutionized communications infrastructure, by pushing intelligence to the edges while hiding the diversity of underlying technologies through well-defined interfaces. Any end device is a traffic source or sink and intelligent endpoints adapt their traffic to what the infrastructure can support. Our challenge is to understand how these principles can be suitably applied in formulating a new information-centric energy network for the 21st Century. We believe that an information-centric approach can achieve significant efficiencies in how electrical energy is distributed and used. The existing Grid assumes energy is cheap and information about its generation, distribution and use is expensive. Looking forward, energy will be dear, but pervasive information will allow us to use it more effectively, by agilely dispatching it to where it is needed, integrating intermittent renewable sources and intelligently adapting loads to match the available energy.},

	abstract = {The main objective of present study is to predict daily global solar radiation (GSR) on a horizontal surface, based on meteorological variables, using different artificial neural network (ANN) techniques. Daily mean air temperature, relative humidity, sunshine hours, evaporation, and wind speed values between 2002 and 2006 for Dezful city in Iran (32°16′N, 48°25′E), are used in this study. In order to consider the effect of each meteorological variable on daily GSR prediction, six following combinations of input variables are considered:
(I)
Day of the year, daily mean air temperature and relative humidity as inputs and daily GSR as output.
(II)
Day of the year, daily mean air temperature and sunshine hours as inputs and daily GSR as output.
(III)
Day of the year, daily mean air temperature, relative humidity and sunshine hours as inputs and daily GSR as output.
(IV)
Day of the year, daily mean air temperature, relative humidity, sunshine hours and evaporation as inputs and daily GSR as output.
(V)
Day of the year, daily mean air temperature, relative humidity, sunshine hours and wind speed as inputs and daily GSR as output.
(VI)
Day of the year, daily mean air temperature, relative humidity, sunshine hours, evaporation and wind speed as inputs and daily GSR as output.
Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF) neural networks are applied for daily GSR modeling based on six proposed combinations.
The measured data between 2002 and 2005 are used to train the neural networks while the data for 214 days from 2006 are used as testing data.
The comparison of obtained results from ANNs and different conventional GSR prediction (CGSRP) models shows very good improvements (i.e. the predicted values of best ANN model (MLP-V) has a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) about 5.21\% versus 10.02\% for best CGSRP model (CGSRP 5)).},

The neural-network verification was performed using the hourly measurements of diffuse solar-radiation obtained during the year 2002. The neural network was developed based on both feature determination and pattern selection techniques. It was found that the inclusion of the atmospheric long-wave radiation as input improves the neural-network performance. On the other hand traditional meteorological parameters, like air temperature and atmospheric pressure, are not as important as long-wave radiation which acts as a surrogate for cloud-cover information on the regional scale. An objective evaluation has shown that the diffuse solar-radiation is better reproduced by neural network synthetic series than by a correlation model.},
